# NodeJS-File-Manager
This is a file manager built using Node.js. The code for this repository is partially sourced from: https://github.com/serverwentdown/file-manager.

Since the code provided in the original repository did not function as expected, I have made the necessary fixes and modifications. The implementation of busboy has been replaced with multer. Additionally, some functionalities have been added or removed in this modified code. Please note that the rename implementation has been removed as I encountered difficulties in fixing it. You can refer to the original code from the repository mentioned above.

I have also included a folder called "Fake-Login" which can be used to point to the original server running this file manager. The "Fake-Login" folder is also programmed in the same language. The username for login is "admin", and the password is "something@123".

It's important to note that I'm not an expert in this field. While I have made efforts to address any issues or bugs in the modified file manager, there may still be some remaining. If you come across any problems, please feel free to report them in the "Issues" tab of this repository.
